- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/marcosvrs/wtf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/marcosvrs/wtf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.
